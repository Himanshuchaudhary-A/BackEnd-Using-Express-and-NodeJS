For experimental in json file ->>>>>>

The --experimental-json-modules flag is used in Node.js to enable ECMAScript (ES) module support for JSON modules. 
This is a feature that's currently under development and not yet fully supported, hence the 'experimental' label. 
It allows you to import JSON files as ES modules. 
However, please note that this feature might not be stable and its usage and behavior could change in future Node.js versions.


For proxy->>

Proxies in backend development are used for various purposes, such as load balancing, caching, data transformation, or security. 
They act as intermediaries between a client and a server.

If you don't use a proxy, the client will communicate directly with the server. This might lead to several issues. 
For instance, if the server is down, the client won't be able to access the data. 
Proxies can help by providing a fallback option, like a cache. Also, they can enhance security by hiding the server's identity, 
preventing direct access, and filtering malicious requests.


then what does CORS package do and how ir  is differnet from proxy->>

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows web browsers to make requests to a different domain than the one 
the user is currently on. It's a security feature that prevents a website from making requests to a different server without permission. 
A proxy, on the other hand, is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client and another server. 
It can be used for various purposes, such as load balancing, caching, or in this case, to add necessary headers 
(like CORS headers) that the origin server might not include.
While a proxy can be used to implement CORS, they are not the same thing. A proxy is a more general concept, a
and CORS is a specific use case for it. If you don't use a proxy, your server would need to include the necessary CORS headers in its 
responses. If it doesn't, the browser will block the request due to the Same-Origin Policy.
